Python script using PythTB for numerical calculations of the SSH model. There are several ways to use these files.

a) Inspect the code and the output in ssh.html in your browser. No interaction is possible.

b) Open ssh.ipynb with Jupyter notebook if it is installed on your computer. pythtb.py must be included in the same directory (or installed via pip, see http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/install.html). You can execute the code, modify it, change the parameters, etc.

c) Run the notebook online at https://jupyter.org/try Click on "Try classic notebook" and then wait a bit until a notebook loads. Then go to File -> Open and a new tab opens up with a list of files. There you upload the ssh.ipynb file and pythtb.py and open the ssh.ipynb file you want to use. Then you can run it interactively, it is similar to mathematica.

d) Use pieces of the script to create your own one. Have fun playing with the SSH model.
